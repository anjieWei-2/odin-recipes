<h2>Ingrediends</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces (about 2 cups) elbow macaroni or any pasta shape of your choice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon salt (for boiling water)</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (sharp cheddar works great) </li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk </li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter </li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instruction</li>
    <li>Drain the cooked pasta and set it aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the butter is melted, add the flour and whisk continuously to create a smooth paste (roux). Cook for about 1-2 minutes, but be careful not to let it brown. </li>

    <li>Season the sauce with salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using). Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
